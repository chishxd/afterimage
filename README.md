## About

**AFTERIMAGE** is a time loop puzzle game created for the **Campfire Overdrive** game jam. It demands perfect coordination with your past self.

Every action you take is recorded and replayed by a ghost of your previous loop. Use these afterimages of your past movements strategically to solve puzzles and escape the room. Stand on pressure plates, coordinate timing, and think in multiple timelines to find your way out.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Ghost Replays**: Your past self appears as a ghost, perfectly recreating your previous movements
- **Puzzle Solving**: Use your afterimages to activate multiple pressure plates, hold doors open, or create distractions

## Controls
